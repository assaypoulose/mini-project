        <p>Photography is the art, science, and practice of creating images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is a versatile medium that has evolved significantly since its inception, incorporating technological advancements and artistic innovations.</p><br>
        <p>Photography is not only a technical skill but also an art form, allowing individuals to express their creativity, tell stories, and capture moments in time. Advancements in digital technology have democratized photography, making it accessible to a broader audience and allowing for rapid sharing and dissemination of images through online platforms.</p>
